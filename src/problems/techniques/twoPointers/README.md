- The Two Pointer Technique
-
- - The idea is to use two pointers to traverse the same array
- - The benefit is saving space and time
- - When to use it? When we need to manipulate an array or list
- by comparing elements with each other. This technique is efficient
- because we can process two elements per loop instead of just one.
- - Implementation types:
- 1.  One pointer at the beginning of the array and one at the end
- 2.  Both pointers at the beginning, but jumping further in each iteration.
